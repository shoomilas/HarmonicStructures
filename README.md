# HarmonicStructures
Tool for string musicians, intended to visualise scales and arpeggi on user-defined fingerboards, e.g.
printing major scaleâ€™s notes layout for 9-string extended-range guitars in various non-standard tunings.
Minimalistic GUI written in WPF

## Author's note:
By golly, this code is old and needs a rework. Where are the interfaces? Seriously, operator overloading? But hey, it works and it's a cool tool that I still use today.
